In the above table, I have jotted down the time taken for multiplying matrix A of dimension (sizexsize) 
and B of dimension (sizexsize) to output the resultant array of (sizexsize) dimension.

As the size increases for the matrix A and B, the time taken by OpenMP setup is better than that of 
Non OpenMP setup. This is because of the massive parallelisation provided by OpenMP. 

For smaller sizes of input matrices, the Non OpenMP setup performs better, because the time taken to 
spin up threads and do the computation in OpenMP takes longer than single-threaded computation in 
Non-OpenMP setup.
